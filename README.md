An interactive Quiz App built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The app challenges players to answer randomly loaded questions within a limited time per question, testing their HTML knowledge and response speed.

This project focuses on improving logical thinking and DOM manipulation skills while practicing JavaScript concepts such as event handling, timers, score calculation, and dynamic content updates.

🎮 How It Works

The player is presented with a question and multiple-choice answers.

The player selects an answer and clicks the Submit button.

A countdown timer limits the time to answer each question.

Each correct answer increases the score.

The game continues until all questions are answered.

A final result message is displayed showing performance.
